Micropython drivers for PicoCalc 

Keyboard driver in python : Done (not tested yet, havn't got my PicoCalc...)
ILI9488 driver in C module/ python : C part has been done for fast 4,8 bit LUT operation, frameBuf based class in python in progress.
Speaker driver: N/A

After I got my PicoCalc, I will compiler a micropython firmware with REPL redirection to TFT and i2c keyboard and ulab module.
