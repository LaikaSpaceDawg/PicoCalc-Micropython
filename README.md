# MICROPYTHON DRIVERS FOR PICOCALC

## KEYBOARD DRIVER IN PYTHON  
Done (not tested yet, haven't got my PicoCalc...)

## ILI9488 DRIVER IN C MODULE/PYTHON  
C part has been done for fast 4,8 bit LUT operation, frameBuf based class in python in progress.

## SPEAKER DRIVER  
N/A

## FUTURE PLAN  
After I got my PicoCalc, I will compile a micropython firmware with REPL redirection to TFT and i2c keyboard and ulab module.
